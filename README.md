# GorbovShop-v2
A better version of the original GorbovShop

## Emulator
The emulator used was Nexus 5X with API 28(Oreo)

## Menus
I omitted to implement any additional menus to application as I thought that it did not need any extra functionality in that department.

## Additional Information
While this app's performance is generally good, I did notice some slow downs when scrolling through the CardViews


## Improvements
What I would have liked to worked on more, given the time, would be the CheckoutActivity to make it look better. But as time was of the essence,
I kept it simple like my previous iteration of this app.
